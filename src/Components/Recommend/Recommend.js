Any team would be lucky to have Xavier on it because he brings such a unique approach to each and every problem."</p><p className="text-author">-Hayden Manning JavaScript Engineer at THINaÃ«r</p></li>
                        <li><p className="text-body">"In the time that I have known Xavier he has demonstrated qualities which make it my sincere pleasure to recommend him for a position in web development. Anyone can write code - not everyone brings confidence, enthusiasm for learning, strong communication, and leadership to a team.
